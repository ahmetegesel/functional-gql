# gql-functional

An experimental project to implement a simple GraphQL API using Functional Programming.

It's become very popular to use functional programming in any kind of application lately. 
It was way imposible to find useful resources about functional programming. We were stuck in
OOP world and tried to invent tons of Desing Patterns to overcome structural problems and
tried hard to maintain our projects.

Since whole industry started to embrace the functional programming, here is an example GraphQL
API project in which I used functional programming paradigm to make the code simpler, yet very 
flexible, reusable and more testable.

It's still in proggress..

## More info will come...

Feel free to check the code, though.
